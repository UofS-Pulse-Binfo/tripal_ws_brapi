Requirements
============

Tripal WS Brapi requires that you have the following installed or setup in your
Tripal website.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 0

   * - **Tripal 3 (with Tripal Web Service extension)**
     - `http://tripal.info <http://tripal.info>`_
   * - **CHADO**
     - `http://gmod.org/wiki/Chado <http://gmod.org/wiki/Chado>`_
   * - **Drupal 7.x**
     - `https://www.drupal.org <https://www.drupal.org>`_


Since some database queries involve data from multiple Chado tables, an intermediate
knowledge of Structured Query Language or SQL query, particularly using TABLE JOINS
and combining conditions is beneficial in creating most BrAPI calls.
