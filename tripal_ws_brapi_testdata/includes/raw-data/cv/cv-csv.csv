"KP Traits: Lentil", "Development of improved lentil cultivars well-adapted to the local environment is an on-going process in the breeding program and is critical for long-term genetic gain. Recent climate instability adds another layer of complexity to breeding efforts."
"KP Trait Methods: Lentil", "Continued genetic improvement of lentil will, therefore, involve the introduction of new alleles that extend beyond the existing adapted pool of germplasm."
"KP Trait Units: Lentil", "The information will be used to determine the genetic basis of the contrasting adaptation characteristics of lentils from the three main growing regions: northern temperate, Mediterranean and S. Asia."
"KP Observable", "Resources developed by this project will improve the agility of the lentil breeding program by introducing genetic diversity with greater precision, and speed up the breeding cycle."
"KP CVALUE", "A systematic study of symbiont diversity will allow for a better understanding of ways to improve the nitrogen fixation process in lentils."
